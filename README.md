## FAQ's/Project Intro
### What is Cecil Libraries?
Cecil Libraries are a group of libraries in which extend functionality to many API and provide utilities as a Pseudo-API for several necessity's.
### Who is Cecil?
Both a Member of the Vessel Chaosyr, and the Mascot of our Libraries. Mascot wise she is as originally described by Chaosyr "10ft tall, raven, succubus, whom is Bi, Poly, and a Femboy". That's as far as we are with her at the moment, if more details arrive it will be on the Organizations main page, figured we'd fill in for the case anyone's wondering what the logo stems from.
### What is the Library this Tester is focused on for?
The library is primarily for enabling the ability to utilize ANSI Color Codes on a much greater scope within the Console associated with most Console Apps. It also contains some functions for converting HSV/HSL, Gray and Hex Code into RGB. Note HSL/HSV rounding is slightly off somewhere by a point or two in present so it might not be perfect.
## Documentation
This is essentially a compilation of all Cecil Testers made and to be in one repo with sub repo links to each. Its mainly a Ease of Access but if you wanted you could also use this as a Hub of Sorts to reach each tester, and run them from one spot without needing to clone multiple repos, you can do this via running `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` after cloning the base repository or by added `--recursive` into the `git clone` from my research. For each testers documentation visit their sub repo.
